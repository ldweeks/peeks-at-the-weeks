# 1950

**December 20, 1950**

(From a publicity letter written just before I left the U.S.)

Linda Lou, Ronnie Dee and I are sailing January 5, 1951 on the Queen Mary and hope to be met at Cherbourg, France by Claylon who left the U.S. in August far a year's study in Brussels, Belgium. I am anticipating my trip more now that I an sure my sister, Hilda Mitchell, is going along. She has a leave of absence from the Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis and will have the experience of the trip and of seeing Europe for about seven weeks.
